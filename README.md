## Features:

* Start location - change the location where you can access the menu
* Money location - change the spawn of the money carts for each bank
* Items - configure the usable items to what you want them to be
* Managers - will spawn in random locations around the bank and can be killed for the key card
* Security System - hack the security panels by the vault to open / close the door
* Vault Door - open the door with a thermal drill
* Money - heist animation for taking the money
